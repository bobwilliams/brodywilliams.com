        <h1>I got bit by a snake!</h1>
        <p><em>Monday, September 2, 2013</em></p>
        <p>Kids, take it from me...becareful where you go putting your nose and you might find yourself in trouble.</p>
        <p>What am I talking about you ask? I was bitten by a baby copperhead and oh boy did that hurt.</p>
        <p>I am feeling much better now but I was in the vet hospital for 3 days. My face swelled up to 3 times it's normal size.  I was given 2 doses of anti-venom and all sorts of pain and anti-biotics.</p>
        <p>My family loves me though and didn't make me tough it out. They cried, prayed and did everything they could to ensure I was ok and would get better.</p>
        <p>Well, I am on my way to recovery that's for sure and do you want to know the best part?</p>
        <p>My tail still wags!! :)</p>

        <h1>I have a new home!</h1>
        <p><em>Saturday, August 10, 2013</em></p>
        <p>Wow, was it ever a hot day today! Hot and humid to be exact. The kind of day that Charlestonians like to brag about to anyone not from around here as if it's something special to be sought after.</p>
        <p>It was so hot that I couldn't even bring myself to wag my tail not even once that day.  I just laid there in a crate with another puppy, whom I didn't really even know, in this sweltering heat just waiting to get back home; not really sure where that would be actually.</p>
        <p>You see, I was there along with 20 or other "dogs" as part of Palmetto Paws adoption ring.  That's right...ring...and I say it with the utmost affection.  They really do care as they rescued me when I was only 3 weeks old from a Craig's list add they saw.</p>
        <p>But while they are noble in their cause, they too have to balance honesty, morales and ethics sometimes to ensure us orphans find a good home.</p>
        <p>And I think I may have just struck gold!  As I laying there, so oppressed from the humidity and heat and just waiting for it all to end, along came this family of 5.  A mom and dad, a young son and two little girls.</p>
        <p>I had not gotten excited about anyone else that had come by that day and honestly I didn't get excited over this family. This family that picked up, petted, and fawned over everyone else there.  None of them really agreed on which pup was the best; that is until they finally saw me.</p>
        <p>The dad couldn't barely contain himself he was so excited over me and the kids were almost about to pull me apart, fighting over who got to hold me. Of course, the mom was wanting to ensure the right decision was made as I could tell that she commits for life when she does.</p>
        <p>Well, they loved me, no one else did, and they took me home. Bought a ton of toys and a nice new crate just for me.</p>
        <p>They love me and I love them...and my tail hasn't stopped wagging since.</p>
