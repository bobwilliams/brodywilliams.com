        <h1>Ugh...my tummy!</h1>
        <p><em>Sunday, November 3, 2013</em></p>
        <p>Well, if you've ever heard someone say a dog will eat themseleves to death and didn't believe it...jokes on you :)</p>
        <p>Yep, I tried to eat myself to death, unknowningly that is, and almost succeeded it if hadn't been for my ever fast to respond and ever aware mom.</p>
        <p>Friday morning, I took advantage of the fact that my sister, Anna Jayne, was paying more attention to feeding me than to my sneaking into the big bag of food in the pantry where she got the food.</p>
        <p>And as such, I was able to eat over 3lbs of food before I was found out.  In fact, I even went on to eat the food she put in my bowl.</p>
        <p>My tummy swelled so much with the dry dog food, that it couldn't perform its contractions to digest the food nor was there any more liquid in my stomach...basically the food had absorbed all my stomach juices.</p>
        <p>So yep...had my mom not been so attentive to me, noticing that I wasn't feeling good, and if she hadn't been so quick to respond, I very well could have died that night.  That's what the doctor said anyhow.</p>
        <p>Now, with stiches inside, 20 staples outside and surgery to remove all the excess dog food...I am getting back to normal.</p>
        <p>Sure my surgery hurts a bit and I'll have some scars but I have a great family and a fantastic mom.</p>
        <p>And I know all this because my tail is wagging again!</p>

        <h1>I graduated!</h1>
        <p><em>Tuesday, October 22, 2013</em></p>
        <p>I'm officially learned now!!  That's right, I have graduated from Candlewood K-9 Academy!</p>
        <p>Big thanks to James for being such a patient and wonderful teacher too.  He really took the time to give me the care and instruction I needed without treating me like just another student and without looking to just make a buck.</p>
        <p>My mom and dad sure are proud of me too.  In fact, they've been so happy with me about all that I have learned that they cannot stop telling me what a good boy I am.</p>
        <p>Now granted, I know I am a good boy and deserving of this attention, but come on mom!  Quit kissing me infront of my friend!</p>
        <p>Well, I guess I'll either have to join the real world now and find a job or maybe I can keep on the education path and start taking a new class...yea, that's a good idea.</p>
        <p>I know...I'll just keep wagging my tail!</p>

        <h1>I got bit by a snake!</h1>
        <p><em>Monday, September 2, 2013</em></p>
        <p>Kids, take it from me...becareful where you go putting your nose and you might find yourself in trouble.</p>
        <p>What am I talking about you ask? I was bitten by a baby copperhead and oh boy did that hurt.</p>
        <p>I am feeling much better now but I was in the vet hospital for 3 days. My face swelled up to 3 times it's normal size.  I was given 2 doses of anti-venom and all sorts of pain and anti-biotics.</p>
        <p>My family loves me though and didn't make me tough it out. They cried, prayed and did everything they could to ensure I was ok and would get better.</p>
        <p>Well, I am on my way to recovery that's for sure and do you want to know the best part?</p>
        <p>My tail still wags!! :)</p>

        <h1>I have a new home!</h1>
        <p><em>Saturday, August 10, 2013</em></p>
        <p>Wow, was it ever a hot day today! Hot and humid to be exact. The kind of day that Charlestonians like to brag about to anyone not from around here as if it's something special to be sought after.</p>
        <p>It was so hot that I couldn't even bring myself to wag my tail not even once that day.  I just laid there in a crate with another puppy, whom I didn't really even know, in this sweltering heat just waiting to get back home; not really sure where that would be actually.</p>
        <p>You see, I was there along with 20 or other "dogs" as part of Palmetto Paws adoption ring.  That's right...ring...and I say it with the utmost affection.  They really do care as they rescued me when I was only 3 weeks old from a Craig's list add they saw.</p>
        <p>But while they are noble in their cause, they too have to balance honesty, morales and ethics sometimes to ensure us orphans find a good home.</p>
        <p>And I think I may have just struck gold!  As I laying there, so oppressed from the humidity and heat and just waiting for it all to end, along came this family of 5.  A mom and dad, a young son and two little girls.</p>
        <p>I had not gotten excited about anyone else that had come by that day and honestly I didn't get excited over this family. This family that picked up, petted, and fawned over everyone else there.  None of them really agreed on which pup was the best; that is until they finally saw me.</p>
        <p>The dad couldn't barely contain himself he was so excited over me and the kids were almost about to pull me apart, fighting over who got to hold me. Of course, the mom was wanting to ensure the right decision was made as I could tell that she commits for life when she does.</p>
        <p>Well, they loved me, no one else did, and they took me home. Bought a ton of toys and a nice new crate just for me.</p>
        <p>They love me and I love them...and my tail hasn't stopped wagging since.</p>
